            <h3>Keego Harbor, MI Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>The first non-native settlers to the area arrived between 1825 and 1830. Cass Lake drew many wealthy residents to purchase land along the lake for vacationing. In 1890, a railway line was built through Keego Harbor to connect to Detroit and Pontiac, making the area much more accessible. At the turn of the century, a prominent Pontiac lawyer, Joseph E. Sawyer, purchased and platted land just to the southwest along Orchard Lake. He built a canal to connect the smaller Dollar Lake to Cass Lake and declared the area to be a harbor on the eastern edge of Cass Lake. He named the area Keego, which was an Ojibwe word meaning 'fish' from the poem The Song of Hiawatha. The community was originally part of West Bloomfield Township before incorporating as an independent city in 1955.</p>
